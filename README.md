### CONCLUSIONS: 

In this graph, FoxNews has more positive tweets on January 8th of 2018 afternoon, maybe because many
people tweet about Golden Globe Awards. 

In addition, it would be better to analyze in a longer period of time because this analysis of only 100 tweets per organization or Media Outlet depends on at what time is done.
